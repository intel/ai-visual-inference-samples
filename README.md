## Releases
Each release of the Intel® AI Visual Inference Samples provides samples for use with a single, specific AI Inference framework.  These samples are optimized for best performance with the configurations they are released with, and for best results it is recommended that you use the latest release intended for your preferred AI inference framework.  Target AI Inference framework can be easily identified by the string following the version number in the release tag, for example a release targeting pytorch may look like v0.5.0-**pytorch**.   
If a specific update is required, you may use the tip of main, all samples from main will function as expected, but be aware optimal performance is not guaranteed.  

## Requirements

### Operating System Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04
